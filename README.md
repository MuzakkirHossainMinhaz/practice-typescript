# practice_typescript

Explore my TypeScript journey from the basics to advanced levels, encompassing a deep dive into object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This repository showcases my hands-on practice, featuring a range of code snippets and projects. Dive into the world of types, interfaces, classes, and more as I honed my skills in TypeScript. An organized compilation of my learning, this repository reflects my commitment to mastering the language and OOP paradigm.

## Notes

### What is TypeScript?

-   **TypeScript** is an Object Oriented Programming Language that is built on top of JavaScript with **Extra Features**.
-   **TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript, which means that TypeScript includes all the features of JavaScript and adds additional features on top of it.
-   **TypeScript** is designed to provide optional static typing and other features that make it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications. With TypeScript, you can write code with types, interfaces, classes, and tother constructs that help catch errors at compile-time and provide better tooling support for developers. TypeScript code is then transpiled into JavaScript, so it can run on any JavaScript runtime, and it allows developers to gradually adopt and integrate static typing into their existing JavaScript codebase.

### Why TypeScript?

There are some disadvantages of JavaScript:

-   Dynamically Typed Language
-   Difficult to Manage Large Codebase
-   No Compile Time Type Checking
-   Does not have built-in support for OOP
-   Difficult to build robust tools like refactoring and autocompletion IDEs.

When working in a Large Application with multiple developers:

-   Very difficult to maintain the codebase
-   Hard to find bugs
-   Catch errors only in runtime

```ts
TypeScript code can be compiled into older JavaScript versions.
```

### Benefits of TypeScript

-   Support Older Browser
-   Type Safety
-   Increase Productivity
-   Less Bugs and Less Testing

### Comparison between JavaScript and TypeScript

| JavaScript                                               | TypeScript                                 |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Dynamically typed                                        | Static typed                               |
| Interpreted                                              | Compiled                                   |
| Limited rich tooling support                             | Rich tooling support                       |
| Can be challenging to manage and maintain large codebase | Easy to manage and maintain large codebase |
